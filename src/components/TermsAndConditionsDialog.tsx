Welcome to [Your Website Name] ("we," "our," "us"). These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your access to and use of our website, services, and all related features (collectively, the "Service"). By accessing or using our Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

1. Eligibility

You must be at least 13 years old or the legal age of digital consent in your jurisdiction to use this Service. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you meet this requirement.

2. User Responsibilities

You agree to:

• Provide accurate and lawful content (images, text, etc.).
• Not use the platform for illegal, harmful, or offensive purposes.
• Not upload content that violates copyright, trademarks, or any third-party rights.
• Use the comics you generate only in accordance with applicable laws.
We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts found in violation of these rules.

3. AI-Generated Content

The comic output is created using artificial intelligence (OpenAI and image generation models). While we strive for creative, accurate, and appropriate content, AI output may occasionally be imperfect or unpredictable.

We do not guarantee that:

• The comic will meet your expectations in terms of tone, accuracy, or detail.
• The generated content will be suitable for all audiences.
• You are solely responsible for the use and distribution of the AI-generated content.

4. Ownership & Copyright

You retain ownership of any original content you upload (e.g. images, text).
You also own the rights to the final comic generated by the Service, including for personal and commercial use, unless the content includes third-party elements you do not own.
By using our service, you grant us a non-exclusive, revocable license to display your generated comic on our website as part of our public gallery or promotional materials — only with your consent.

5. Prohibited Content

You may not upload, submit, or use content that:

• Contains hate speech, harassment, or threats
• Depicts or promotes illegal activities, nudity, or explicit material
• Infringes on any copyright or intellectual property
• Violates the privacy of any individual

We reserve the right to remove or report such content.

6. Payments and Refunds

Digital comic downloads are non-refundable.
Printed comic orders via Lulu are subject to Lulu's printing and shipping policies.
If your printed order arrives damaged or incorrect, please contact us within 14 days of delivery with proof of the issue.
All payments are processed securely via third-party providers (e.g. Stripe, PayPal).
You will receive an invoice or receipt via email after every purchase.

7. Third-Party Services

We integrate services provided by:

• OpenAI – for AI-generated text and image content
• Lulu – for global printing and shipping
• Payment providers – for secure transactions

We are not responsible for the performance or policies of these external platforms. Their use is subject to their own terms and privacy policies.

8. Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. Please refer to our [Privacy Policy] for details on how we collect, store, and use your data in compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other applicable laws.

9. Account Access

If you create an account:

• You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your credentials.
• You agree not to share or transfer your login details to others.
• We may disable or terminate accounts that violate these Terms or appear to be used fraudulently.

10. Availability and Modifications

We may update, modify, or discontinue the Service at any time without notice. We are not liable for any loss related to downtime, changes, or interruptions to the platform.

11. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law:

• We are not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.
• Our total liability for any claim related to the Service shall not exceed the amount you paid to us in the last 12 months, if any.

12. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [Insert Country or State]. Any legal disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in [Insert City/Country].
